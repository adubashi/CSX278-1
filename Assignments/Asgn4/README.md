### Acknowledgement

Chris Richardson, the curator of microservices.io, is one of the leading 
consultants and educators regarding microservices. His writing on the 
architecture formed the basis of our understanding of the pattern.
Martin Fowler is a well known speaker regarding software patterns, 
and provides insight into the practical benifits and drawbacks of microservices.
We also used the JHipster documentation as a resource to learn about its 
integration into the JHipster generator.
