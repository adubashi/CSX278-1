# Overview

This assignment is designed to simulate what it is like to be a principal or
other non-technical team member at a consulting company that is trying to win
new business. You have worked with your customers (the mentors) to learn about
their business problems and goals. However, your competitors have also been
working with your customers. 

You are going to serve as the lead team member assembling a proposal to win
the mentor's business. You need to think through how you could create an
application that would account for the critical needs and possible benefits that the
mentors discussed. You then need to capture your creative vision for this application
in a proposal. The mentors will then evaluate these proposals to select the most
compelling solutions for their challenge problems.

## Proposal Requirements

You must create proposals to bid on projects from three different mentors.

The format of the proposal is up to you, but it must be represented by one or
more concrete artifacts (e.g., written proposal, slides, video). You are more
than welcome to reach out to the mentors to get additional information on the
challenge problems. If you need a mentor's contact information, please email
the instructor.

The proposal should be at least equivalent effort to a 2pg written proposal. If you 
produce a video, this might be a 1min video. If you create a deck of slides,
this might be a 10-15 slide deck.

Be creative in your proposal. Your goal is to wow the mentors and get them 
excited about the vision that you have to solve their problem. 

In addition, your proposal must have the following elements:
  
  1. A rough set of requirements that you envision being built out for the project
     (they do not have to be user stories at this point)
  2. Your approach for building out these requirements and ensuring that they
     are going to meet the mentor's needs
  3. How you propose interacting with the mentor 
  4. How you would run the development (rough method)
  5. What you think might be doable by the end of this semester with a team of
     3-4 CS students and what you think could be accomplished with an additional
     semester of work
  6. What is unique and special about your vision for the solution   

## Due Dates

Your three proposals are due by midnight on 10/2. Proposals should be emailed
to the TA and cc' the instructor. For large files greater than 25mb, please 
email a link to Box, Drive, Dropbox, Youtube, or some other location.
