### Acknowledgement

Our reading materials were selected based on Frederick's recommendation of YouTube video and looking at Facebook documentation (the authors of React).
We also chose a highly shared article on Scotch.io and a cartoon on Medium which provides a graphical representation of how Flux and React work together.
The date of publication/ last update for each resource was checked to ensure that all information is recent.
